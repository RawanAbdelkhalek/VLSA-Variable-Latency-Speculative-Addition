# VLSA-Variable-Latency-Speculative-Addition
Variable Latency Speculative Addition (VLSA) is an approximate adder with error check and error recovery units. Design and implemented by Verilog


The adder is designed that is exponentially faster than traditional adders, but it can produce incorrect results, which is tolerable and it is only for very few combinations of the input, so an error correction unit is designed and implemented as well as an error correction unit.
